          I create fully responsive and functional websites using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and PHP. Whether you need a personal blog, portfolio, or small business website, I can design and develop a site that’s fast, secure, and mobile-friendly. I also help with redesigning old websites to give them a modern look and feel. Hosting setup and domain connection are also part of the service if needed.
